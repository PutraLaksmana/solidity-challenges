# Challenge 04

An update awaits, but with it comes a subtle shift. The UserOperation struct has changed, its format now different. To proceed, you'll need to carefully refactor your existing code to align with this new structure. The details are hidden in the new versionâ€”can you uncover them and adapt your implementation?

**Task**:
- Refactor the existing code to align with the new PackedUserOperation struct format.
- run `forge test --mp test/solidity/challenge-04/Challenge04.t.sol` to test your implementation.
