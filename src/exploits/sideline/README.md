# Sideline

An exclusive token airdrop is on the horizon, requiring users to register to receive the token. However, external contracts are not permitted on the list. Your task? Find a way to bypass the restrictions and ensure your contract makes it onto the list.

Your Challenge:

- Bypass the restrictions. Find a way to register your contract despite the "no contract" rule.
- Prove your success by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/sideline/Sideline.t.sol` with your solution.
