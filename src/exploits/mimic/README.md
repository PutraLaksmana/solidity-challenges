# Mimic

To Whom It May Concern,

I have identified a serious flaw in your system that grants me the ability to withdraw all funds. You have 24 hours to address this vulnerability before I execute my plan and drain the entire balance.

What You Must Do:

- Locate and fix the vulnerability before the deadline.
- Confirm your fix by running forge test --mp test/exploits/mimic/Mimic.t.sol.

Failure to act promptly will result in the immediate loss of all funds. This is your final chance to prevent a complete financial disaster.
