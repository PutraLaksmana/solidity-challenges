# False Start

A new NFT drop is here, and it's offering a free mint, but there's a catch. The contract is designed to restrict every user to just one NFT. Your job? Prove it wrong.

Your Challenge:

- Break the rules. Attempt to mint the entire supply of NFTs despite the contractâ€™s limitations.
- Validate your approach by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/false-start/FalseStart.t.sol`
