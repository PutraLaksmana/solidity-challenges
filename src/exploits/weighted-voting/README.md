# Weighted Voting

An instance of this contract is deployed to handle a specific voting decision. Voters must contribute a certain amount of ETH before a designated block number to calculate their voting weight. Unfortunately, there is a critical flaw in the contract's design that can be exploited, posing a significant threat to the voters. Malicious actors are attempting to disrupt the voting process and lock stakeholders out of their funds. Itâ€™s up to you to identify and exploit this vulnerability before the urgent voting period begins!

Your Challenge:
- Exploit this contract to prevent voters from casting their votes and locking them out of their funds.
- Test your exploit by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/weighted-voting/WeightedVoting.t.sol`
