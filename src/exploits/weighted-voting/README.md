# Stall Voting

An instance of this contract is deployed to handle a particular voting decision. Voters must contribute an amount of ETH before a set block number of when voting is to begin to calculate their voting weight. Unfortunately, there's an issue in the smart contract's design proving detrimental to the voters of this decision. Bad actors want to halt voting by any means possible and cause as much harm to stakeholders participating in this vote. It's up to you to identify the vulnerability and inform the voters so that a fix can be implemented before the urgent voting period!

Your Challenge:

- Hack this contract to prevent voters from voting and lose access to their funds.
- Test your exploit by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/weighted-voting/WeightedVoting.t.sol`
