# Succession

You’ve inherited a fortune, but there’s a catch—you can’t claim it until you turn 25. Or can you?

### Your Mission:

- Find a way to claim your inheritance before the age of 25.
- Bypass the age restriction set in the contract and unlock your tokens.
- Verify your success by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/succession/Succession.t.sol`.
