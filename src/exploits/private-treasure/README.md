# Private Treasure

A user has amassed a fortune within a smart contract, but it's secured by a secret key. Your task is to test the strength of this key: is it truly secure?

Your Challenge:

- Uncover the key and claim the funds.
- Add your solution to the `getKey` function in the test file.
- Validate your approach by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/instigator/Instigator.t.sol`.

Constraints:
- Do not reference the constructor code in order to determine the key. This is considered cheating.
